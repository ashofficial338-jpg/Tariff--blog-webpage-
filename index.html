                <h2>For other uses, see Tariff (disambiguation). Not to be confused with Tarif.</h2>
                <p>A tariff or import tax is a duty imposed by a national government, customs territory, or
                    supranational union on imports of goods and is paid by the importer. Exceptionally, an export tax
                    may be levied on exports of goods or raw materials and is paid by the exporter. Besides being a
                    source of revenue, import duties can also be a form of regulation of foreign trade and policy that
                    burden foreign products to encourage or safeguard domestic industry.[1] Protective tariffs are among
                    the most widely used instruments of protectionism, along with import quotas and export quotas and
                    other non-tariff barriers to trade.</p>

                <h2>Is India's $500bn purchase pledge realistic?</h2>
                <p>Under the framework, India has expressed an intention to buy $500bn of US goods over five years,
                    including energy, aircraft, technology products and coking coal.

                    Critics question whether this is achievable.

                    According to GTRI, this would require India's annual imports from the US to more than double every
                    year. The announcement also relies on private sector decisions that are beyond government control.

                    The commitment also "risks inflating India's import bill and eroding its trade surplus with the US",
                    Systematix Research said, warning of longer-term pressure on external balances.

                    However, Goyal has described the target as "extremely conservative", citing rising demand for
                    aircraft, energy and data centre equipment.

                    He says India already has tens of billions of dollars worth of aircraft orders in the pipeline and
                    expects overall imports to grow as the economy expands.

                    Despite several unanswered questions, India's stock markets rose sharply on the back of the deal
                    announcement, with lower tariffs
                    , stronger energy ties and deeper economic cooperation with the US expected to add to the country's
                    growth prospects.</p>

                <h2>Oil, tariffs and farming: What we still don't know about US-India trade deal</h2>
                <p>India's opposition parties, farmer groups and trade experts have raised concerns about the interim
                    India-US trade agreement after additional details were released on Friday.

                    A joint statement confirmed that India will purchase $500bn (£367.4bn) worth of US goods over five
                    years, but did not mention a pledge by Delhi to stop Russian oil purchases.

                    Earlier last week, the countries had announced a trade deal, with the US cutting tariffs on Indian
                    goods to 18% from 50%.

                    Final negotiations are still under way, but the interim deal has raised four key questions</p>
